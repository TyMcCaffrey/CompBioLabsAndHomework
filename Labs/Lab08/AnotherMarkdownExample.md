# Cheat Sheet
## What is good documentation?

### Qualities of good documentation
* It describes contents of a repo/directory
* It puts data and code in context
* It aids reproducibility
* It explains essentials for using files and code

### Examples
1. Good documentation may show `snippets of code` or perhaps whole blocks:
```
bestVariableEvah <- myAwesomeFunction( args )
```
2. Good documentation might also have a [link to relevant info](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
3. You can even do [D & D-style markdown!](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/) 

### Conclusion 
As a wise cat once said:
