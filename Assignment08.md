# Effect of drought on California pond trematode disease systems
## Introduction
For this project I want to use this dataset to analyze the effect of drought on snail trematode disease dynamics. This analysis will provide information on how volatile environmental conditions brought on by climate change may impact the disease dynamics that are so important to many ecological systems. To do this I want to define the parameter of drought based on the imputed pond sizes present in my dataset in order to then perform a statistical analysis on the effect of drought on snail density and parasitic prevalence.

## Summary of Data to be Analyzed

**NOTE**: *Everything you write must be in your own words and with proper attribution of ideas to original sources.  Failing to do so constitutes plagairism.*

### Goals of original study that produced the data (~1 paragraph)
The data I will be working on for this project was collected by the Johnson Lab through CU in the field research facilities in California. I obtained this data by reaching out to my research advisor Dr. Peiter Johnson

### Brief description of methodology that produced the data
The data was gathered over several years through the collection and dissection of snail hosts to examine trematode parasites, recording information about the nail populations, ponds they were taken from, and types of parasitic infection.

### Type of data in this data set:
Data Table

#### Format of data  
.csv
#### Size of data (i.e., megabytes, lines, etc.)
1.93mb
#### Any inconsistencies in the data files?  Anything that looks problematic?  
Other than observations with NAs it looks good. Doesn't look like their are any internal formatting inconsistencies
#### What the data represent about the biology? (optional; this subsection may not be needed if the biological significance has already been covered in your previous descriptions)

This analysis will provide information on how volatile environmental conditions brought on by climate change may impact the disease dynamics that are so important to many ecological systems.

## Detailed Description of Analysis to be Done and Challenges Involved
For this project I want to use this dataset to analyze the effect of drought on snail trematode disease dynamics. This analysis will provide information on how volatile environmental conditions brought on by climate change may impact the disease dynamics that are so important to many ecological systems. To do this I want to define the parameter of drought based on the imputed pond sizes present in my dataset in order to then perform a statistical analysis on the effect of drought on snail density and parasitic prevalence. This will involve cleaning the dataset, writing code to see which ponds were repeatedly sampled consistently over a ten year span, using pond perimeter to assign low pond size years as drought years, performing a statistical analysis on how drought impacts parasite-host dynamics. Finally I will  utilize ggplot to visualize this data and any findings that the statistical analysis may have in a clear and understandable way.
Steps I anticipate the analysis requiring
-Cleaning the data (dyplr)
-Setting up some way to define and visualize drought (pond perimeter)
-Statistical analysis of drought, parasite prevalence, and snail prevalence
-Visualizations of these relationships with drought over time with ggplot
